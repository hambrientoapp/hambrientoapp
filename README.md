## 🍔 HAMBRIENTO (HUNGRY)

"thinking of you we develop this app"

It is a project that seeks to help the hungry to find places to eat that meet all three Bs (in spanish):

* **B**ueno (Good)
* **B**onito (Pretty)
* **B**arato (Cheap)

You can collaborate by reporting a place that meet all three Bs or also evaluating.

To report you must indicate on the form the following:

* Name of the place
* Category (🍔Burger, 🍕Pizza, 🍣Sushi, 🌮Mexican, 🇻🇪Venezuelan,  🇵🇪Peruvian)
* Direction
* Coordinates (Latitude and Longitude)

 **Developers** please look at the issues and take one.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
